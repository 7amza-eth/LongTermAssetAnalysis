## Summary

In our analysis of SPY, ETH, and BTC, we decided to take a robust approach using a variety of different techniques to paint a clear picture of what the best investment was between the year 2016 and today. We took a look at volatility, returns, and different risk-adjusted ratios to reach out conclusion. The data showed that ETH was the best investment based on the growth it has sustained in the past six years. We then ran Monte Carlo Simulation based off various portfolios to see rough ballpark for future predictions. Etherum returned with the highest predictions for future ROI. This massive potential growth, however, comes with the highest risk and volatility of the three assets
